# Auto-Light
Auto light is consisted by two parts
1. inertial remote controller
2. control board to control the LED strips
# RGB_LED
Provides a button to switch the LED strips into different modes(No restriction),
and a receiver in pair with the remote controller
(while receiving signal from remote controller the LED strips can only be lit on at right time, and right ambient light).
# RGB_LED_without_button
Removed a button to switch the LED strips into different modes(to reduce the control board size, also, it's redundant),
and a receiver in pair with the remote controller
(while receiving signal from remote controller the LED strips can only be lit on at right time, and right ambient light).
